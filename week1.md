Mauna-Kea Weekly Update 1	
For our first meeting with Rocky, we held an online call over Google meet with the other team on this project, Williamson. Prior to the call, questions and slides were sent to ensure efficiency and communication between the client and the MSiA students.
During our call, we were briefed on the background story and current company landscape of Cottage Door Press.  Questions were posed mainly to their inventory management, return process, and data management. Over the course of 1 hour, we covered topics including: SKUs, fulfillment processes, cash flow situation, technical infrastructure, and industry-related knowhow. Details can be found in this [meeting note document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H6MhtAcCnkmM40jbwApJZmIVJ-jup5xcCIp69ofL82Y).
We concurred that the main deliverable for the project would be: How to accurately predict the demand from Amazon’s platform? Are Amazon’s POs placed correctly? If not, how do we improve CDP’s sales forecast? Deeper exploratory work into the data, however, is much needed before the determination of details and timeline. We expect to understand CDP’s data during the next week and clarify any ambiguous information given in our future weekly calls with Rocky.
